# DVE-2017-0001: securelogin.arubanetworks.com captive Wi-Fi portals fail to authorise with Ubuntu 17.10+ / systemd-resolved clients

## Description

Ubuntu 17.10+ uses systemd-resolved local caching stub resolver
(127.0.0.53) for system dns resolutions. When trying to connect and
authorise with the captive portal at securelogin.arubanetworks.com, at
some point it fails to resolve correctly and thus users are failing to
pass captive portal authorisation and access internet.

Originally this was reports on Ubuntu bug tracker at
https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/systemd/+bug/1727237

This might be a bug in Ubuntu/systemd-resolved and/or
securelogin.arubanetworks.com DNS spoofing/captivity and/or both.

## Proposed fix

There are currently no proposed fixes, as Ubuntu developers are trying to find captive arubanetworks.com Wi-Fi.
Any assistance in locating and/or debugging this captive portal would be highly appreciated.

Previous version of Ubuntu were using resolvconf, optionally with a
local dnsmasq caching resolving dns client, which did work with these
captive portals.

## Workaround

No workarounds are currently known.

## Files

None at the moment.
